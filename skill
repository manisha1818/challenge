  <h1>About My Application</h1>
  <p>
    The Skill Match Application helps users by matching their skills with the right opportunities. 
    First, users register and upload their resumes. Then, they can choose between creating a team 
    or applying for job shortlisting. The system automatically compares resumes, finds the best 
    skill matches, and provides results as either suitable teams or job opportunities. 
    This makes the process faster, smarter, and easier for students and job seekers.
